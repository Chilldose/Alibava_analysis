  SN_cluster: 5 # SN what the whole cluster must have at minimum to be considered, values great then 7 are useless
  timing:
    - 0 # Minimum timing window

  max_cluster_size: 7 # Directly affects runtime!!!
  sensor_type: "n-in-p" # Sensor Material
  automasking: True # Tries to find non physical or garbage hits (wrong ADC direction) and excludes them from calculation (costs moderate CPU)
